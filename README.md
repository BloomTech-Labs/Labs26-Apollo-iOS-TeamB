Apollo allows users to create and join topics. These topics contain surveys that are used in place of daily standup to simplify, speed up, and provide something for leads or other team members to look at after the fact so information can be logged and saved. Topics in this sense can be seen as teams, or the specific group that will be answering the owner or leads questions. The surveys are the daily stand up questions that the team members will respond to. Before team members respond to the surveys, they will be shown a list of context questions that the owner has already answered so the members have more information on why they are answering the specific questions that were sent out that day. Joining a topic is done through a join code that is given to the owner after topic creation. Only the owner can view the code but any user can join the topic using said code. After users respond to a survey, other users may initiate a thread on their response in order to have more specified conversations surrounding a specified response and question.
